Usage:
  python3 clustering_fun.py -k={clusters} [options] [/path/to/input/file.csv]

    Options:
      -k={value} (Required, number of clusters 1 to 1000)
      -n={value} (Number of points to gaussian generate if no CSV file is provided)
      -l={value} (Optional limit on distance from center to a location being classified in km)
      -p (plot output)
      -v (verbose output)

    If a csv file is not provided, the number of points must be specified with -n={value}
    If a csv file is provided then the -n option is ignored



Example run:
  ./clustering_fun.py -v -p -n=5000 -k=5 -l=2500
  
  This will create 5 clusters with a total of 5000 points with gaussian distribution
  The -v will run the clustering with verbose output
  The -p will plot initial cluster positions as well as final cluster centers in separate images
  The -l limits the maximum classification distance of a point to 2500km
